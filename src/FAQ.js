        question: "I just booked my appointment online, should I call the clinic to confirm my appointment?",

        question: "Can you guarantee my results in less than 48 hours?",
        answer: "Many patients are booking cheap flights at short notice however you must bear in mind that if these tests need to be conducted, you should be leaving at least 48 hours between test time and departure. Over 95% of our results are sent to patients within 40 hours, and there are live statistics on our website advising current turnaround times, patients booking tests for flights under 48 hours away assume all responsibility."

    {
        question: "I need a certificate and I didn't pay for one, can you add one onto my booking?",
        answer: "If you have not attended for your test yet, please amend your booking following the link in your confirmation email. If you have already attended, please call the clinic to pay your additional Â£50, have your passport details to hand so we can note them on your certificate."
